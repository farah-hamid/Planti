## Project Idea and Project Aims 

The idea is to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
plant shop, which is a digital platform where users can
browse, select, and purchase plants.
The goal is to provide a visually appealing and user-
friendly interface that offers a seamless and enjoyable
plant shopping experience for customers.

## Project functionalities 

- Registration
- Viewing Product
- Editing User Information
- Purchase Product


##  Usage Flow of The Application
1. Welcome Page: When the application is launched, the welcome
page appears first. The user is presented with options to either log in
or sign up.
2. Log In Page: If the user is already registered, they can enter their
login credentials on the log in page. After successfully logging in, the
user proceeds to the home page.
3. Sign Up Page: If the user is new and doesn't have an account, they
can navigate to the sign-up page from the welcome page. They
complete the registration process by providing the required
information. Once the registration is complete, they are redirected
back to the log in page where they can now log in using their newly
created credentials.
4. Home Page: After logging in, the user is directed to the home
page. The home page lists all the available products. The user can
browse through the products and choose to add items to their cart
by selecting the "+" button. Alternatively, they can view each
product individually and then add them to the cart.
5. Navigation: In the home page, the user can also use the choice box
to select a specific page to navigate to. This allows them to access
different sections or features of the application easily.
6. Profile Page: The user can navigate to the profile page from the
home page. In the profile page, they can view and edit their personal
information or make any necessary updates.
7. Cart: The user can access the cart from the home page. In the cart,
they can view the items they have added, make edits such as
changing quantities or removing items, and proceed with completing
their order.
8. Order Page: After finalizing the cart, the user proceeds to the
order page. Here, they can review the selected products and the
total price before confirming the order.
9. Payment Page: Once the user confirms the order, they are
directed to the payment page. In this page, they enter their credit
card information and complete the payment process.
10. Confirmation: After completing the payment, a confirmation
page appears, indicating the successful completion of the payment.
The user can then navigate back to the home page.
This detailed usage flow outlines the sequence of pages and actions
in your application, starting from the welcome page, through
registration/login, product browsing, cart management, order
confirmation, payment, and final confirmation. It provides a
structured and intuitive user experience, ensuring a smooth and
seamless journey for the users of our application.

## Java Database Programming

A database provides a structured and organized approach to
store and manage data.
The "User" table would store information about the app's
users, including their names, contact details, and login
credentials. The "Product" table would contain details about
the available products, such as their names, and prices
Finally, the "Payment" table would contain details about the
payment transactions, including payment IDs, amounts, and
expiryDate.
By utilizing these tables, the application can perform various
operations seamlessly. For example, it can retrieve user
information to personalize their experience, display product
details for browsing and purchasing, process orders, and
securely handle payment transactions. The database acts as a
central repository, allowing the application to access and
manipulate the necessary data efficiently.
